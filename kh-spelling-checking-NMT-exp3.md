# Seq2Seq Model Experiments

For this time, I will build Seq2Seq NMT model for Khmer spelling checking...  

## Revist the Experimental Setting of the Previous 

```
I will train two models. One is training with edit-distance 1 errors and another is edit-distance 2 errors.  
For the testing, I will use three test-sets. They are as follows:  

edit-1 test-set (test set of Khmer word segmented data with edit-1)  
edit-2 test-set (test set of Khmer word segmented data with edit-2)  
manual test-set (the whole data that manually prepared)  
```

## Preprocessing

create a new folder for Seq2Seq experiment:  

```
root@7a2ffa404585:/home/ye/exp/kh-spell# mkdir seq2seq
root@7a2ffa404585:/home/ye/exp/kh-spell# cd seq2seq/
```

I copied char-final/ folder ...  
data and vocab file info are as follows:
