## Question: 1


Hi! ChatGPT I hope you already know about Markdown and other similar or alternatives to Markdown. Can you write a survey paper about this? Including comparison and discussions on this variants. 

# Markdown and Its Variants: A Survey

## Abstract
This paper provides a survey of Markdown, its usage, and several notable alternatives or variants. We discuss the features of each, and compare them for their capabilities and relative advantages.

## Introduction

Markdown is a lightweight markup language created by John Gruber and Aaron Swartz in 2004, designed to be easily readable and writeable. The main goal is to offer a plain text format that can be converted to HTML or other formats. However, the simplicity of the original Markdown specification led to the emergence of various Markdown flavors and alternatives over time.

## Markdown Variants

### 1. MultiMarkdown
MultiMarkdown extends the original Markdown syntax to include features like footnotes, tables, and document metadata. This version, developed by Fletcher Penney, is useful for users who require more advanced features while maintaining simplicity.

### 2. GitHub Flavored Markdown (GFM)
As the name suggests, this variant is used by GitHub. It includes features such as syntax highlighting, task lists, tables, and allows for SHA referencing and issue referencing within GitHub repositories.

### 3. CommonMark
CommonMark is a strong effort to standardize Markdown. It is a highly specified version of Markdown which provides a comprehensive syntax specification to address inconsistencies in the various flavors of Markdown.

### 4. Markdown Extra
Created by Michel Fortin, Markdown Extra is an extension to PHP Markdown, offering additional features such as tables, definition lists, footnotes, and more.

## Alternatives to Markdown

### 1. AsciiDoc
AsciiDoc offers more features compared to Markdown, and is used for writing documentation, articles, books, websites, slideshows, and more. It has a more complex syntax but is powerful and flexible, with capabilities such as including other files and conditional document assembly.

### 2. reStructuredText
Developed as part of the Docutils project, reStructuredText is widely used in the Python community for documentation. It provides more explicit markup and advanced features like directives for embedding dynamic content.

### 3. Textile
Textile is a lightweight markup language initially developed by Dean Allen, providing a simple syntax for basic formatting and links, as well as more advanced features like tables, images, footnotes, and citations.

### 4. Org-mode
A mode in Emacs, Org-mode is a document editing, formatting, and organizing tool, which includes additional features like TODO lists, project planning, and literate programming.

## Discussion

While all of these Markdown variants and alternatives have their pros and cons, the choice typically depends on the specific requirements of a project. 

For simple tasks like note-taking or writing a readme file, the original Markdown syntax or GitHub Flavored Markdown might be sufficient. When more complex features like tables, footnotes, and document metadata are needed, MultiMarkdown, Markdown Extra or AsciiDoc might be a better fit.

For technical documentation, especially in Python projects, reStructuredText is a common choice. If you're working in an Emacs environment and need advanced features like time tracking or literate programming, Org-mode could be the right tool.

## Conclusion

Markdown, with its simplicity and ease of use, has inspired a range of variants and alternatives, each with their unique features. The choice among them depends on the context, required features, and personal preference. As Markdown continues to be widely adopted, we expect its influence on document markup to continue and evolve.

This is a very basic survey paper. A full academic survey might include a more detailed history, discussion on each variant and alternative, comparisons in different use-cases, user studies, future trends, etc.

## Question: 2

Could you explain me about document metadata in details?

In a general sense, metadata refers to data about data. It provides additional information or details about a particular set of data. When applied to documents, document metadata is the information that describes the characteristics of a document, which could include various details depending on the context.

Below are several types of document metadata:

1. **Descriptive Metadata**: This metadata describes a document for purposes such as discovery and identification. It can include elements such as title, abstract, author, and keywords.

2. **Structural Metadata**: This metadata indicates how compound objects are put together, for example, how pages are ordered to form chapters.

3. **Administrative Metadata**: This metadata provides information to help manage a resource, such as when and how it was created, file type and other technical information, and who can access it.

In the context of Markdown variants like MultiMarkdown, document metadata usually refers to a set of information about the document, including but not limited to:

- **Title**: The name of the document.
- **Author(s)**: The person/people who wrote the document.
- **Date**: The date of the document's creation or publication.
- **Tags or Keywords**: Words or phrases that describe the content of the document.
- **Summary or Description**: A brief overview of the document's contents.
- **Language**: The language in which the document is written.

This metadata is usually included at the top of the document, often in a specific format. For example, in MultiMarkdown, you might include metadata like this:

```
Title: My Document
Author: John Smith
Date: 2023-05-25
Tags: markdown, documentation, example
Summary: This is an example of how to include metadata in a MultiMarkdown document.
```

Including metadata in your documents can provide several benefits. It can make your documents easier to search and categorize, provide important context, and be used by programs that process your documents to control how they are displayed or converted to other formats.

## Question: 3

Explain to me in details about AsciiDoc including a table of it's all commands or cheat sheet table.

AsciiDoc is a text document format for writing notes, documentation, articles, books, slideshows, web pages, and blogs. AsciiDoc files can be translated to many formats including HTML, PDF, EPUB, man page.

Here's a brief introduction to the AsciiDoc syntax:

| Syntax | Description | Example |
|---|---|---|
| = Title | Document title | `= My Document` |
| == Section title | Section headings (also ===, ====, ...) | `== My Section` |
| _emphasis_ | Emphasize text | `_emphasis_` |
| *bold* | Bold text | `*bold*` |
| `monospace` | Monospace text | `` `monospace` `` |
| +monospace+ | Monospace text (preserves spaces) | `+monospace+` |
| [quote, Author, Source] | Blockquote with attribution | `[quote, John Doe, Source]\n____\nQuote here\n____` |
| .... | Literal block | `....\nLiteral text\n....` |
| '' | Unconstrained quotes (word boundaries do not matter) | `*'bold'*_emphasis_'monospace'` |
| -- | Open block (generic container, like HTML div) | `--\nSome content\n--` |
| - \| * | Unordered list | `- List item` or `* List item` |
| . | Ordered list | `. List item` |
| [cols="1,2,3"] \| | Table (specify column proportion) | `[cols="1,2,3"]\n|===\n|Cell in column 1|Cell in column 2|Cell in column 3\n|===` |
| [link] | Inline links | `https://www.example.com[Example]` |
| image::path[Alt Text] | Image | `image::example.jpg[Example Image]` |
| include::filename[] | Include another file | `include::example.txt[]` |

Note that AsciiDoc is very feature-rich and provides many more options and features not included in this short table, like macros, footnotes, bibliography, indexes, table of contents, and many others. For the complete syntax and more detailed explanation, you can refer to the official AsciiDoc User Guide: https://asciidoctor.org/docs/asciidoc-syntax-quick-reference/ 

It's also worth noting that AsciiDoc documents are just plain text, so you can open and edit them with any text editor. The AsciiDoc format is simple to learn and does not require any special software. The syntax was designed to be easy to read and write, so it can be used intuitively and effectively even by people who are not familiar with AsciiDoc.

## Question: 4

Can you explain to me about reStructuredText language? Including cheat sheet of it's command usages ...
