## Question: 1


Hi! ChatGPT I hope you already know about Markdown and other similar or alternatives to Markdown. Can you write a survey paper about this? Including comparison and discussions on this variants. 

# Markdown and Its Variants: A Survey

## Abstract
This paper provides a survey of Markdown, its usage, and several notable alternatives or variants. We discuss the features of each, and compare them for their capabilities and relative advantages.

## Introduction

Markdown is a lightweight markup language created by John Gruber and Aaron Swartz in 2004, designed to be easily readable and writeable. The main goal is to offer a plain text format that can be converted to HTML or other formats. However, the simplicity of the original Markdown specification led to the emergence of various Markdown flavors and alternatives over time.

## Markdown Variants

### 1. MultiMarkdown
MultiMarkdown extends the original Markdown syntax to include features like footnotes, tables, and document metadata. This version, developed by Fletcher Penney, is useful for users who require more advanced features while maintaining simplicity.

### 2. GitHub Flavored Markdown (GFM)
As the name suggests, this variant is used by GitHub. It includes features such as syntax highlighting, task lists, tables, and allows for SHA referencing and issue referencing within GitHub repositories.

### 3. CommonMark
CommonMark is a strong effort to standardize Markdown. It is a highly specified version of Markdown which provides a comprehensive syntax specification to address inconsistencies in the various flavors of Markdown.

### 4. Markdown Extra
Created by Michel Fortin, Markdown Extra is an extension to PHP Markdown, offering additional features such as tables, definition lists, footnotes, and more.

## Alternatives to Markdown

### 1. AsciiDoc
AsciiDoc offers more features compared to Markdown, and is used for writing documentation, articles, books, websites, slideshows, and more. It has a more complex syntax but is powerful and flexible, with capabilities such as including other files and conditional document assembly.

### 2. reStructuredText
Developed as part of the Docutils project, reStructuredText is widely used in the Python community for documentation. It provides more explicit markup and advanced features like directives for embedding dynamic content.

### 3. Textile
Textile is a lightweight markup language initially developed by Dean Allen, providing a simple syntax for basic formatting and links, as well as more advanced features like tables, images, footnotes, and citations.

### 4. Org-mode
A mode in Emacs, Org-mode is a document editing, formatting, and organizing tool, which includes additional features like TODO lists, project planning, and literate programming.

## Discussion

While all of these Markdown variants and alternatives have their pros and cons, the choice typically depends on the specific requirements of a project. 

For simple tasks like note-taking or writing a readme file, the original Markdown syntax or GitHub Flavored Markdown might be sufficient. When more complex features like tables, footnotes, and document metadata are needed, MultiMarkdown, Markdown Extra or AsciiDoc might be a better fit.

For technical documentation, especially in Python projects, reStructuredText is a common choice. If you're working in an Emacs environment and need advanced features like time tracking or literate programming, Org-mode could be the right tool.

## Conclusion

Markdown, with its simplicity and ease of use, has inspired a range of variants and alternatives, each with their unique features. The choice among them depends on the context, required features, and personal preference. As Markdown continues to be widely adopted, we expect its influence on document markup to continue and evolve.

## Question: 2

Could you explain me about document metadata in details?

In a general sense, metadata refers to data about data. It provides additional information or details about a particular set of data. When applied to documents, document metadata is the information that describes the characteristics of a document, which could include various details depending on the context.

Below are several types of document metadata:

1. **Descriptive Metadata**: This metadata describes a document for purposes such as discovery and identification. It can include elements such as title, abstract, author, and keywords.

2. **Structural Metadata**: This metadata indicates how compound objects are put together, for example, how pages are ordered to form chapters.

3. **Administrative Metadata**: This metadata provides information to help manage a resource, such as when and how it was created, file type and other technical information, and who can access it.

In the context of Markdown variants like MultiMarkdown, document metadata usually refers to a set of information about the document, including but not limited to:

- **Title**: The name of the document.
- **Author(s)**: The person/people who wrote the document.
- **Date**: The date of the document's creation or publication.
- **Tags or Keywords**: Words or phrases that describe the content of the document.
- **Summary or Description**: A brief overview of the document's contents.
- **Language**: The language in which the document is written.

This metadata is usually included at the top of the document, often in a specific format. For example, in MultiMarkdown, you might include metadata like this:

```
Title: My Document
Author: John Smith
Date: 2023-05-25
Tags: markdown, documentation, example
Summary: This is an example of how to include metadata in a MultiMarkdown document.
```

Including metadata in your documents can provide several benefits. It can make your documents easier to search and categorize, provide important context, and be used by programs that process your documents to control how they are displayed or converted to other formats.

## Question: 3

Explain to me in details about AsciiDoc including a table of it's all commands or cheat sheet table.

AsciiDoc is a text document format for writing notes, documentation, articles, books, slideshows, web pages, and blogs. AsciiDoc files can be translated to many formats including HTML, PDF, EPUB, man page.

Here's a brief introduction to the AsciiDoc syntax:

| Syntax | Description | Example |
|---|---|---|
| = Title | Document title | `= My Document` |
| == Section title | Section headings (also ===, ====, ...) | `== My Section` |
| _emphasis_ | Emphasize text | `_emphasis_` |
| *bold* | Bold text | `*bold*` |
| `monospace` | Monospace text | `` `monospace` `` |
| +monospace+ | Monospace text (preserves spaces) | `+monospace+` |
| [quote, Author, Source] | Blockquote with attribution | `[quote, John Doe, Source]\n____\nQuote here\n____` |
| .... | Literal block | `....\nLiteral text\n....` |
| '' | Unconstrained quotes (word boundaries do not matter) | `*'bold'*_emphasis_'monospace'` |
| -- | Open block (generic container, like HTML div) | `--\nSome content\n--` |
| - \| * | Unordered list | `- List item` or `* List item` |
| . | Ordered list | `. List item` |
| [cols="1,2,3"] \| | Table (specify column proportion) | `[cols="1,2,3"]\n|===\n|Cell in column 1|Cell in column 2|Cell in column 3\n|===` |
| [link] | Inline links | `https://www.example.com[Example]` |
| image::path[Alt Text] | Image | `image::example.jpg[Example Image]` |
| include::filename[] | Include another file | `include::example.txt[]` |

Note that AsciiDoc is very feature-rich and provides many more options and features not included in this short table, like macros, footnotes, bibliography, indexes, table of contents, and many others. For the complete syntax and more detailed explanation, you can refer to the official AsciiDoc User Guide: https://asciidoctor.org/docs/asciidoc-syntax-quick-reference/ 

It's also worth noting that AsciiDoc documents are just plain text, so you can open and edit them with any text editor. The AsciiDoc format is simple to learn and does not require any special software. The syntax was designed to be easy to read and write, so it can be used intuitively and effectively even by people who are not familiar with AsciiDoc.

## Question: 4

Can you explain to me about reStructuredText language? Including cheat sheet of it's command usages ... 

reStructuredText (also known as reST) is a markup language developed by the Docutils project. It's widely used in the Python community for software documentation. Like other lightweight markup languages, reStructuredText is designed to be both easy to read in plain text and easy to parse into other formats like HTML or LaTeX.

Here's a brief introduction to the reStructuredText syntax:

| Syntax | Description | Example |
|---|---|---|
| = Title = | Document title (also -, ~, #, etc.) | `= My Document =` |
| == Section title == | Section headings (also --, ~~, ##, etc.) | `== My Section ==` |
| *emphasis* | Emphasize text | `*emphasis*` |
| **bold** | Bold text | `**bold**` |
| ``monospace`` | Monospace text | `` `monospace` `` |
| | Quoted literal | `` :``monospace``: `` |
| .. [note] | Footnote | `.. [1] This is a footnote.` |
| .. image:: path | Image | `.. image:: example.jpg` |
| `.. code:: language` | Code block | `.. code:: python\n\n   def hello():\n       print("Hello, world!")` |
| - | Unordered list | `- List item` |
| 1. | Ordered list | `1. List item` |
| .. table:: title | Table | `.. table:: My Table\n\n   +-------+-------+\n   | Cell 1 | Cell 2 |\n   +-------+-------+` |
| `target <http://example.com>`_ | Inline links | `Visit `Example <http://example.com>`_ for more info.` |
| .. include:: filename | Include another file | `.. include:: example.txt` |

reStructuredText is much more than this, it supports a wide variety of directives for things like including external documents, syntax highlighting code blocks, creating tables of contents, and more. It can be extended by Sphinx (a documentation generation tool) to support linking between documents, automatic documentation of Python classes and functions, and more.

For the complete syntax and more detailed explanation, you can refer to the official reStructuredText Documentation: http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html

The flexibility and extensibility of reStructuredText makes it a powerful tool for writing technical documentation, especially in the Python ecosystem.

## Question: 5

Can you explain to me about Textile markup language? Including cheat sheet of it's command usages ... 

Textile is a lightweight markup language that uses a text-based syntax to provide an easy way to structure and format text. It was originally developed by Dean Allen and is used for writing articles, READMEs, and other types of web content.

Here's a brief introduction to the Textile syntax:

| Syntax | Description | Example |
|---|---|---|
| h1. Title | Document title (also h2., h3., etc.) | `h1. My Document` |
| _emphasis_ | Emphasize text | `_emphasis_` |
| *bold* | Bold text | `*bold*` |
| @code@ | Monospace text (inline code) | `@code@` |
| "text":url | Inline links | `"Example":http://example.com` |
| !image_url! | Image | `!http://example.com/image.jpg!` |
| bc.. code | Block code | `bc.. print("Hello, World!")` |
| bq.. quote | Blockquote | `bq.. This is a quote.` |
| * | Unordered list | `* List item` |
| # | Ordered list | `# List item` |
| |. | Table | `|. Cell 1.|\n|. Cell 2.|` |

Textile also supports more advanced features, such as attributes for controlling the style and alignment of elements, footnotes, citations, and more.

For the complete syntax and more detailed explanation, you can refer to the official Textile Documentation: https://textile-lang.com/

Textile offers a balance between ease of use and power, making it a good choice for those who need more control over their text formatting than Markdown provides, but don't need the complexity of something like reStructuredText or AsciiDoc.

## Question: 6

Can you explain to me about Org-mode usages in details? including cheat sheet of Org-mode language

Org-mode is a powerful and versatile mode for Emacs, a widely-used text editor. Org-mode allows you to maintain to-do lists, plan projects, and author documents with a fast and effective plain-text system. Here's a brief introduction to some of the commands and syntax used in Org-mode:

| Syntax | Description | Example |
|---|---|---|
| * Title | Document title (also **, ***, etc. for subsections) | `* My Document` |
| /emphasis/ | Emphasize text | `/emphasis/` |
| *bold* | Bold text | `*bold*` |
| =code= | Inline code | `=code=` |
| [[link][description]] | Inline links | `[[http://example.com][Example]]` |
| [[file:img.jpg]] | Image | `[[file:img.jpg]]` |
| #+BEGIN_SRC language | Code block | `#+BEGIN_SRC python\nprint("Hello, World!")\n#+END_SRC` |
| - | Unordered list | `- List item` |
| 1. | Ordered list | `1. List item` |
| |+| | Table | `| Cell 1 | Cell 2 |\n|-|\n| Cell 3 | Cell 4 |` |
| TODO | Task item | `* TODO Write a paper` |
| DONE | Completed task | `* DONE Write a paper` |

These are only the very basics. Org-mode can do much more, including but not limited to:

- Time tracking: You can use `C-c C-x C-i` to start the clock on a task, and `C-c C-x C-o` to stop it.
- Agendas: You can get an overview of all your tasks using `C-c a`.
- Literate programming: You can write code within your Org documents that can be executed and have their results included in the document.
- Exporting: Org documents can be exported to a variety of formats, including HTML, PDF (via LaTeX), Markdown, and more.
- Spreadsheets: You can perform calculations on tables within Org documents.

For more detailed information, refer to the official Org-mode manual: https://orgmode.org/manual/index.html

It's also worth noting that Emacs, the text editor that Org-mode is a part of, has a steep learning curve, but is also very powerful and customizable. If you're interested in using Org-mode, it might be worth spending some time getting to know Emacs first.

## Question: 7

Can you write a python code for markdown parser?  

Creating a markdown parser is a complex task, as Markdown has a very rich syntax. However, Python already has a library called `markdown` which can be used to parse markdown content into HTML. Here is a simple example of how to use it:

First, you need to install the markdown library. You can do it using pip:

```
pip install markdown
```

Then, you can parse markdown text into HTML like this:

```python
import markdown

def parse_markdown(markdown_text):
    html = markdown.markdown(markdown_text)
    return html

# Example usage:
markdown_text = """
# Hello, world!

This is a simple Markdown document.

* Item 1
* Item 2
"""
html = parse_markdown(markdown_text)
print(html)
```

In this code, the `parse_markdown` function takes a string of markdown text and returns a string of HTML.

If you want to write your own parser from scratch, you would need to implement all the rules of the Markdown syntax, which is a substantial task. You would need to write functions to handle headers, lists, links, emphasis, strong emphasis, code blocks, and more, as well as considering nested elements and escaping rules. 

I would recommend using an existing library like `markdown` unless you have a very specific need that it can't meet, as writing your own parser would be a significant amount of work and could potentially introduce bugs or inconsistencies with the official Markdown specification.

## Question: 8

I already know about that markdown Python library. Hey! Don't be lazy. I wanna know your coding knowledge, ChatGPT. Can you write a parser for markdown language with a Python or Perl language for me?

Creating a full Markdown parser is quite complex as it involves handling many intricate rules and edge cases of Markdown syntax. Nevertheless, here's a very simplified version of a Markdown parser written in Python that handles headers, bold, italic, and links.

Note: It's a demonstration of basic parsing principles, and doesn't handle all the nuances of Markdown syntax. For a production-grade parser, you should use a well-tested library like the Python markdown module or a similar tool.

```python
import re

def parse(markdown_text):
    lines = markdown_text.split('\n')
    
    result = []
    for line in lines:
        # Headers
        header_match = re.match("(#{1,6}) (.*)", line)
        if header_match:
            header_level = len(header_match.group(1))
            result.append(f"<h{header_level}>{header_match.group(2)}</h{header_level}>")
            continue
        
        # Bold
        line = re.sub(r'\*\*(.*?)\*\*', r'<strong>\1</strong>', line)

        # Italics
        line = re.sub(r'\*(.*?)\*', r'<em>\1</em>', line)
        
        # Links
        line = re.sub(r'\[(.*?)\]\((.*?)\)', r'<a href="\2">\1</a>', line)

        result.append(f'<p>{line}</p>')

    return '\n'.join(result)

# Usage:
markdown_text = """
# Header1
## Header2
*italic*
**bold**
[link](https://example.com)
"""
print(parse(markdown_text))
```

This will convert headers from `# Header` to `<h1>Header</h1>`, italicized text from `*italic*` to `<em>italic</em>`, bold text from `**bold**` to `<strong>bold</strong>`, and links from `[link](https://example.com)` to `<a href="https://example.com">link</a>`.

Note: This is an overly simplified markdown parser. Markdown has many more features such as nested formatting, lists, blockquotes, images, code blocks, inline code, and more. A real markdown parser would need to handle all these cases correctly.

## Question: 9

Regenarate the above question (i.e. Question: 8) again and I got following response:  

Writing a complete Markdown parser from scratch in either Python or Perl is a complex task that would take quite a bit of code and time to get right. However, I can certainly show you how to create a basic Markdown-like parser using Python, which you can then expand upon to suit your specific needs.

In this simplified version, we'll support two basic features of Markdown: headers (lines beginning with `#`) and emphasis (text enclosed in `*` or `_`). We'll use regular expressions to identify these patterns in the text.

```python
import re

def parse_simple_markdown(text):
    # Split the input text into lines
    lines = text.split('\n')

    # Process each line
    for i, line in enumerate(lines):
        # Headers
        match = re.match(r'(#{1,6}) (.*)', line)
        if match:
            level = len(match.group(1))
            lines[i] = '<h{0}>{1}</h{0}>'.format(level, match.group(2))
            continue

        # Emphasis
        line = re.sub(r'\*(.*?)\*', r'<em>\1</em>', line)
        line = re.sub(r'_(.*?)_', r'<em>\1</em>', line)

        lines[i] = line

    # Join the lines back together and return the result
    return '\n'.join(lines)

# Test the function
markdown_text = """
# Header 1
## Header 2
Some *emphasized* text.
Some _emphasized_ text.
"""
html = parse_simple_markdown(markdown_text)
print(html)
```

In this code, we're using regular expressions to match patterns in the text and replace them with HTML tags. Note that this is a very basic example and doesn't cover many aspects of the Markdown syntax.

Creating a complete Markdown parser would require additional code to handle other features of Markdown such as links, images, blockquotes, lists, code blocks, and more. Also, Markdown has some complex rules for handling things like nested emphasis (e.g., `*outer _inner_*`), which aren't handled by this simple example.

Creating a complete, fully-featured Markdown parser from scratch is a significant task that would require a deep understanding of both the Markdown syntax and the parsing techniques, and probably is beyond the scope of this platform. However, if you're interested in doing so, I would recommend looking at the source code of an existing parser (like Python-Markdown or Mistune) to get an idea of what's involved.
