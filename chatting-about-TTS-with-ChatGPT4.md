 would be expanded into multiple pages with references to numerous studies and experiments. Due to my last training cut-off in September 2021, I'm assuming hypothetical advancements and referencing made-up sources for the years 2022-2023.
 
 ## Question: 3
 
Can you explain to me about FastSpeech 2+ in details? And related works and also implementation steps for a new language ...  

As of my knowledge cutoff in September 2021, FastSpeech 2+ is a hypothetical model. The most recent model in this series is FastSpeech 2, which was introduced following FastSpeech and FastSpeech 1.5. 

Let's review FastSpeech 2 and discuss how it could potentially be extended to a new language, which would likely be similar to implementing a hypothetical FastSpeech 2+ model.

**FastSpeech 2:**

FastSpeech 2 is an extension of FastSpeech, which was designed to overcome the limitations of autoregressive models like Tacotron by avoiding error accumulation and slow inference times. FastSpeech achieved this by using a non-autoregressive approach that directly predicted the target mel spectrogram in parallel.

FastSpeech 2 introduced several advancements over the original FastSpeech:

1. **Variance Adaptive Training:** In contrast to FastSpeech, which used teacher-student training with fixed-length prediction, FastSpeech 2 introduced variance-adaptive training to better learn prosodic information. This allows it to match the duration, pitch, and energy of the ground truth speech more accurately.

2. **Multiple Decoder Heads:** To better model fine-grained prosody, FastSpeech 2 introduced multiple decoder heads in the Transformer-based model, allowing it to focus on different aspects of the speech.

**Related Works:**

FastSpeech 2 is related to several previous works in TTS, including:

1. **Tacotron:** Tacotron and its successor Tacotron 2 are sequence-to-sequence models that use an autoregressive decoder to generate speech. These models served as a starting point for FastSpeech and FastSpeech 2.

2. **Transformer TTS:** Transformer models have been adapted for TTS tasks due to their ability to model long-range dependencies and parallelization capabilities. FastSpeech 2 uses a Transformer-based model.

**Implementing FastSpeech 2 for a New Language:**

The implementation steps for a new language would be similar to those required for any TTS system. Here are the general steps:

1. **Data Collection:** Collect a large dataset of speech audio and corresponding transcriptions in the target language. The quality and quantity of this data will directly influence the performance of the final model.

2. **Preprocessing:** Convert the audio data into a suitable format for model input, usually mel spectrograms or other spectral representations. The transcriptions should be converted into a sequence of linguistic features or phonemes.

3. **Model Training:** Train the FastSpeech 2 model on this data. This involves several steps, including training the duration, pitch, and energy predictors and the mel-spectrogram generator.

4. **Fine-Tuning:** Fine-tune the model, if necessary. This may involve additional training with specific data or adjusting certain model parameters.

5. **Testing and Evaluation:** Evaluate the performance of the model on unseen data. Consider using objective metrics (e.g., Mel Cepstral Distortion) and subjective listening tests.

Please note that these steps could require significant computational resources and expertise in machine learning and speech synthesis.

For the actual code, open-source implementations of FastSpeech 2 (such as [this one](https://github.com/ming024/FastSpeech2)) could be used as a starting point. The code would need to be adapted to handle the specific features of the new language.

## Question: 4

Can you write a code or usage of API relating to Mozilla TTS in details?

Mozilla TTS is a Text-to-Speech engine that you can use to convert text to speech using Python. Here is an example of how to use Mozilla TTS in Python:

First, you need to install the Mozilla TTS package. You can do this via pip:

```bash
pip install TTS
```

Now, in Python, you can use the following script to generate speech from text:

```python
from TTS.utils.manage import ModelManager
from TTS.utils.synthesizer import Synthesizer

# Define the model and vocoder
model = {
    "model_path": "<path_to_model.pth.tar>",
    "config_path": "<path_to_model_config.json>"
}
vocoder = {
    "model_path": "<path_to_vocoder.pth.tar>",
    "config_path": "<path_to_vocoder_config.json>"
}

# Initialize ModelManager
manager = ModelManager()

# Load the model and the vocoder
tts_model, tts_config, tts_vocab = manager.load_tts_model(model["model_path"], model["config_path"])
vocoder_model, vocoder_config = manager.load_vocoder_model(vocoder["model_path"], vocoder["config_path"])

# Initialize Synthesizer
synthesizer = Synthesizer(tts_model, tts_config, tts_vocab, vocoder_model, vocoder_config)

# Synthesize the text
wav = synthesizer.tts("Hello world")

# Save the audio
synthesizer.save_wav(wav, "output.wav")
```

You need to replace `"<path_to_model.pth.tar>"` and `"<path_to_vocoder.pth.tar>"` with the path to your trained models. These are typically saved as `.pth.tar` files. You also need to replace `"<path_to_model_config.json>"` and `"<path_to_vocoder_config.json>"` with the path to the corresponding model configuration files.

If you don't have pre-trained models and config files, you can download them from the [Mozilla TTS GitHub page](https://github.com/mozilla/TTS).

Note that the above code will generate speech and save it to an audio file named "output.wav". You can play this file to hear the synthesized speech.

Lastly, remember that all file paths should be appropriate to your local or server file system structure.

## Question: 5

Write a survey paper of Tacotron 1, Tacotron 2 and Tacotron 3? Including the comparison table among these models.  Some example running or coding of using Tacotron approach.

**Title:** Evolution of the Tacotron Series: An In-depth Examination of Tacotron 1, Tacotron 2, and Tacotron 3

**Abstract:**
This paper offers a comprehensive review and comparison of the successive advancements made in the Tacotron series, including Tacotron 1, Tacotron 2, and the hypothetical Tacotron 3. In light of my knowledge cut-off in September 2021, and the lack of any credible source referring to a Tacotron 3, I'll speculate its possible features based on the evolutionary pattern of its predecessors. This survey also includes practical examples of using the Tacotron approach.

Tacotron 2 improves upon the original model by replacing the Griffin-Lim algorithm with WaveNet, a deep generative model of raw audio waveforms, producing more natural sounding speech. Additionally, it employs a more effective attention mechanism and implements post-net to predict residuals.

**4. Hypothetical Tacotron 3:**
Given the trend from Tacotron 1 to 2, it's reasonable to speculate that a hypothetical Tacotron 3 would offer further advancements in speech naturalness, speed of synthesis, and multi-lingual capabilities, possibly incorporating transformer architectures for better long-term dependency modeling.

**Comparison Table:**

| Model | End-to-End | Spectrogram Generation | Waveform Synthesis | 
|---|---|---|---|
| Tacotron 1 | Yes | Sequence-to-Sequence with Attention | Griffin-Lim |
| Tacotron 2 | Yes | Sequence-to-Sequence with Attention | WaveNet |
| Tacotron 3 (hypothetical) | Yes | Possible use of Transformer architectures | Potential Improvements on WaveNet |

**5. Practical Application:**
Implementing the Tacotron series for TTS synthesis involves Python programming and usage of the corresponding frameworks. The following example demonstrates the use of Tacotron 2 using the Mozilla TTS framework:

```python
# Assuming Mozilla TTS is installed
from TTS.utils.manage import ModelManager
from TTS.utils.synthesizer import Synthesizer

model = {
    "model_path": "<path_to_tacotron2_model.pth.tar>",
    "config_path": "<path_to_tacotron2_config.json>"
}

# Initialize ModelManager and load the model
manager = ModelManager()
tts_model, tts_config, tts_vocab = manager.load_tts_model(model["model_path"], model["config_path"])

# Initialize Synthesizer and synthesize the text
synthesizer = Synthesizer(tts_model, tts_config, tts_vocab)
wav = synthesizer.tts("Hello world")

# Save the audio
synthesizer.save_wav(wav, "output.wav")
```

**6. Conclusion:**
The Tacotron series has made substantial contributions to the evolution of TTS technologies. As this series progresses, it is anticipated that advancements in the field will continue, driving towards high-quality, human-like speech synthesis.

## Question: 7

Do you have an idea/suggestion for developing/implementing TTS model for a new language. However, I wanna focus on low-resourced languages. 

Developing a TTS model for a low-resourced language can be challenging due to the lack of comprehensive and quality datasets. However, various strategies can be employed to overcome these challenges:

**1. Transfer Learning:**

In the absence of a substantial amount of data in the target language, transfer learning can be a powerful tool. You can train a model on a high-resourced language and then fine-tune it on the limited data available in the target language. This approach assumes that the model can generalize some learned features from the high-resourced language to the low-resourced language.

**2. Data Augmentation:**

Data augmentation is a technique used to enhance the quantity and diversity of training data. For speech data, this could involve changing the speed or pitch of the audio, adding background noise, or other similar transformations. This technique can help improve the model's robustness and generalization capability.

**3. Multilingual Models:**

Multilingual models are trained on data from multiple languages, allowing them to learn shared representations across languages. These models can be particularly useful for low-resourced languages, as they can leverage knowledge from high-resourced languages. BERT, XLM, and mBART are examples of multilingual models that have shown success in various NLP tasks.

**4. Phonetic Representation:**

Consider using a phonetic representation of the text, rather than the raw characters. This can help the model generalize better, especially when data is limited.

**5. Utilizing Crowd-Sourcing:**

For data collection, consider utilizing crowd-sourcing platforms to gather speech data in the target language. This could involve setting up a platform where speakers of the language can contribute audio samples and their transcriptions.

**6. Utilizing Text Normalization:**

Text normalization can help improve the performance of TTS models for low-resourced languages. This involves converting written text into a form that can be understood by the TTS system, like expanding abbreviations or converting numbers into words.

**7. Collaborative Training:**

In collaborative training, models trained independently on different datasets are combined to produce a single model. This can help improve the performance on low-resourced languages by combining the strengths of different models.

For implementation, most of the popular TTS architectures like Tacotron and FastSpeech can be adapted for low-resourced languages using the strategies mentioned above. There are various open-source implementations available on GitHub that can serve as a starting point for your model implementation.

Remember that building TTS systems for low-resourced languages is an active area of research, and there are ongoing advancements in this field. Staying updated with the latest research can provide you with new techniques and strategies to improve your model.
