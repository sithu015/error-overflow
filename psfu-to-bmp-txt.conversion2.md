# PSFU to BMP/txt Conversion

## Git Clone

ဒီတစ်ခါတော့ rw-psf perl script ကို သုံးကြည့်မယ်။  

```
(base) ye@ykt-pro:/media/ye/project1/cadt/student/internship/demo/code/console-font-dev$ git clone https://github.com/talamus/rw-psf

## PSFU File Preparation

```
(base) ye@ykt-pro:/media/ye/project1/cadt/student/internship/demo/code/console-font-dev/rw-psf/test-conv$ cp ../../ttf-console-fonts-20170403_abc5771/ye-x.psfu* .
(base) ye@ykt-pro:/media/ye/project1/cadt/student/internship/demo/code/console-font-dev/rw-psf/test-conv$ ls
ye-x.psfu  ye-x.psfu.txt
(base) ye@ykt-pro:/media/ye/project1/cadt/student/internship/demo/code/console-font-dev/rw-psf/test-conv$
