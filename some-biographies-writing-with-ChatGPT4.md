You are expertise in linguistic.   

As an AI language model, I've been trained on a wide range of data sources and can answer many questions about linguistics, such as language structure (syntax, morphology, phonology), semantics, pragmatics, sociolinguistics, psycholinguistics, and historical linguistics. I can also provide explanations on language learning, second language acquisition, and language teaching methods. However, please note that while I strive for accuracy, my responses should be used as a starting point for further research rather than as final authoritative answers. How can I assist you with your linguistics queries?

Do you know John William Alan Okell who was a British linguist notable for his expertise in the field of Burma studies? Could you write an Essay about this scholar including his published books and research papers?

John William Alan Okell was a prominent British linguist who made significant contributions to the field of Burma studies. He was born in Brighton and was educated at The Queen's College, University of Oxford. His interest in languages led him to join the School of Oriental and African Studies (SOAS) as a trainee lecturer in Burmese in 1959. During his time at SOAS, he studied Burmese with Hla Pe and Anna J. Allott, phonetics with R. K. Sprigg and N. C. Scott, and general linguistics with R. H. Robins and Eugénie Henderson. After eighteen months of study, he travelled to Burma, where he spent a year immersing himself in the country's language and culture. He returned for another year-long visit in 1969【10†source】【11†source】.

Okell retired from SOAS in 1999 but continued to teach Burmese through short courses convened in various places, notably Chiang Mai and Yangon. In 2014, he was made an Officer of the Order of the British Empire for his services to UK/Burma relations, and in 2016, SOAS awarded him an honorary doctorate【13†source】【14†source】【12†source】.

Okell was the creator of the Avalaser Burmese computer font and the Chairman of the Britain-Burma Society. He passed away on 3 August 2020 at the age of eighty-six【15†source】【16†source】.

Among his notable works are several books on the Burmese language, including "A Reference Grammar of Colloquial Burmese" (1969), "A Guide to the Romanization of Burmese" (1971), "First Steps in Burmese" (1989), and "Burmese: An Introduction to the Spoken Language" (1994) which came in two books and introduced the script and literary style. He also co-authored "Burmese/Myanmar Dictionary of Grammatical Forms" (2001) with Anna Allott and published "Burmese By Ear/Essential Myanmar" in 2002【17†source】.

In addition to these books, Okell published several research papers that delve into various aspects of the Burmese language and culture. Some of these include "Three 'Immortal' Burmese Songs" (1963, co-authored with Hla Pe and Anna J. Allott), "Learning Music from a Burmese Master" (1964), and "Nissaya Burmese: A Case of Systematic Adaptation to a Foreign Grammar and Syntax" (1965)【18†source】.

Unfortunately, I was not able to find more detailed information about the impact of Okell's research contributions to the field of Burmese studies. I recommend further exploration of his published works and possibly reaching out to scholars in the field to gain a more comprehensive understanding of Okell's influence and legacy.

Despite this limitation, Okell's dedication to the study of Burmese, his significant works on the language, and his contributions to UK/Burma relations unquestionably establish him as a noteworthy figure in the field of Burma studies. His passion and commitment to the language and culture of Burma have left an enduring legacy that continues to inspire and guide scholars in the field.
