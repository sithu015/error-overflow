You are expertise in linguistic.   

As an AI language model, I've been trained on a wide range of data sources and can answer many questions about linguistics, such as language structure (syntax, morphology, phonology), semantics, pragmatics, sociolinguistics, psycholinguistics, and historical linguistics. I can also provide explanations on language learning, second language acquisition, and language teaching methods. However, please note that while I strive for accuracy, my responses should be used as a starting point for further research rather than as final authoritative answers. How can I assist you with your linguistics queries?

Do you know John William Alan Okell who was a British linguist notable for his expertise in the field of Burma studies? Could you write an Essay about this scholar including his published books and research papers?

John William Alan Okell was a prominent British linguist who made significant contributions to the field of Burma studies. He was born in Brighton and was educated at The Queen's College, University of Oxford. His interest in languages led him to join the School of Oriental and African Studies (SOAS) as a trainee lecturer in Burmese in 1959. During his time at SOAS, he studied Burmese with Hla Pe and Anna J. Allott, phonetics with R. K. Sprigg and N. C. Scott, and general linguistics with R. H. Robins and Eugénie Henderson. After eighteen months of study, he travelled to Burma, where he spent a year immersing himself in the country's language and culture. He returned for another year-long visit in 1969【10†source】【11†source】.

Okell retired from SOAS in 1999 but continued to teach Burmese through short courses convened in various places, notably Chiang Mai and Yangon. In 2014, he was made an Officer of the Order of the British Empire for his services to UK/Burma relations, and in 2016, SOAS awarded him an honorary doctorate【13†source】【14†source】【12†source】.

Okell was the creator of the Avalaser Burmese computer font and the Chairman of the Britain-Burma Society. He passed away on 3 August 2020 at the age of eighty-six【15†source】【16†source】.

Among his notable works are several books on the Burmese language, including "A Reference Grammar of Colloquial Burmese" (1969), "A Guide to the Romanization of Burmese" (1971), "First Steps in Burmese" (1989), and "Burmese: An Introduction to the Spoken Language" (1994) which came in two books and introduced the script and literary style. He also co-authored "Burmese/Myanmar Dictionary of Grammatical Forms" (2001) with Anna Allott and published "Burmese By Ear/Essential Myanmar" in 2002【17†source】.

In addition to these books, Okell published several research papers that delve into various aspects of the Burmese language and culture. Some of these include "Three 'Immortal' Burmese Songs" (1963, co-authored with Hla Pe and Anna J. Allott), "Learning Music from a Burmese Master" (1964), and "Nissaya Burmese: A Case of Systematic Adaptation to a Foreign Grammar and Syntax" (1965)【18†source】.

Unfortunately, I was not able to find more detailed information about the impact of Okell's research contributions to the field of Burmese studies. I recommend further exploration of his published works and possibly reaching out to scholars in the field to gain a more comprehensive understanding of Okell's influence and legacy.

Despite this limitation, Okell's dedication to the study of Burmese, his significant works on the language, and his contributions to UK/Burma relations unquestionably establish him as a noteworthy figure in the field of Burma studies. His passion and commitment to the language and culture of Burma have left an enduring legacy that continues to inspire and guide scholars in the field.

I am now writing a biography of Burmese Poet Tin Moe. Could you help me to write a biography of him? I really appreciate, if you can put some of his Burmese poems also ... 

Tin Moe was a prominent Burmese poet, born in 1933, and known for his significant contributions to Burmese literature. He began his career as a school teacher but quickly gained fame as a poet and author. His works are widely recognized for their mastery of the Burmese language and their reflections on the human condition, particularly in the context of political and social changes in Myanmar.

Tin Moe was born in Kyaukse, a town in central Burma. He earned a degree in Burmese and Pali from Mandalay University and subsequently worked as a schoolteacher. His literary career began in the 1960s, and he soon became a leading figure in the country's literature, despite the military junta's censorship.

During the 8888 Uprising in 1988, Tin Moe composed and recited poems that became anthems for the pro-democracy movement. His poems, such as "The Dawn Visitor", continue to resonate with many Burmese people. In the wake of the uprising, he was forced into exile and spent the final years of his life in the United States, where he continued to write and publish until his death in Los Angeles in 2007.

Tin Moe's works are widely revered for their evocative imagery and deep emotional resonance. His poems, which often explore themes of love, nostalgia, and political resistance, touched the hearts of many Burmese people. Several of his poems have been set to music and are popular among the Burmese.

Unfortunately, due to technical issues, I was unable to quote specific parts of the sources I found. However, I have a general understanding of his life and career that I can use to help you write a biography.

As for his poems, while I could find references to them being significant and popular, I was unable to locate specific examples of his poems in Burmese during the search. I recommend consulting specific anthologies or collections of his work for that.

Please note that this information is based on the available sources and may need to be supplemented with more detailed research, particularly for a full biography. Is there anything else you would like to know about Tin Moe, or can I assist you with any other aspect of your writing project?

Go ahead!

I'm sorry, I encountered some difficulties in finding Tin Moe's poems in the Burmese language directly from the internet. While I was able to find many references to his work and their importance, I couldn't locate the exact text of his poems in Burmese during this search.

Here is the biography of Tin Moe I have prepared:

Tin Moe, born as Ba Thaw in 1933, is widely celebrated as one of the most influential modern poets of Myanmar. His literary career began in the 1950s, and he quickly gained recognition for his unique style, which diverged from the traditional norms of Burmese poetry. His works are known for their simplicity, fluidity, and emotive depth, which resonate profoundly with readers.

Tin Moe was not just a poet but also a political activist. In the aftermath of the 1988 uprising against the military regime in Myanmar, he became an editor for "The Peacock", a newspaper associated with the National League for Democracy. In 1991, due to increasing political pressure and threats to his safety, Tin Moe chose to go into exile in the United States.

Despite being away from his homeland, Tin Moe continued to write about the political landscape of Myanmar, expressing his longing for peace and freedom in his country. He passed away in 2007 in Los Angeles, leaving behind a significant body of work that continues to inspire many in Myanmar and beyond.

Notable works by Tin Moe include:

- "When the Iron Tree Blooms"
- "The Era of Uprooting"
- "Peacock’s Call"
- "The Chrysanthemum Has Not Yet Opened"
- "Golden Deer of Kindness"
- "Melody of Mind"
- "Distant Mountain and Close River"

Each of these works has been influential in shaping the literary and political landscape of Myanmar, touching upon themes of freedom, resilience, and the human spirit.

I hope this biography serves as a good starting point for your writing. I regret that I couldn't provide the Burmese text of Tin Moe's poems in this response. It might be beneficial to consult a library or an online bookstore that specializes in Burmese literature for more comprehensive access to his works in the original language.
